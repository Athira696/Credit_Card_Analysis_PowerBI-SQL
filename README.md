# Credit_Card_Analysis_PowerBI-SQL
🚀 Excited to share my latest Power BI project on Week-over-Week Credit Card Transaction Analysis!

In this project, I’ve developed an interactive Power BI dashboard focused on week-over-week (WoW) analysis of credit card transactions and customer spending behavior. This dashboard helps businesses track transaction trends and customer patterns on a weekly basis, providing real-time insights into performance.

🔍 Key Features:

Week-over-Week Analysis: The dashboard’s core feature is to analyze and compare transaction volumes, spending patterns, and customer behaviors week-over-week. It helps businesses identify fluctuations and growth trends in their credit card transactions.
Seamless Data Updates: Once the data is updated in the database, customers simply need to refresh the Power BI dashboard. The latest data automatically populates the dashboard, removing the need for manual updates or intervention.
DAX Measures & KPIs: I’ve utilized advanced DAX functions to create custom metrics that provide meaningful insights, such as:
Total Spend (WoW) – Calculating and comparing total spend from week to week.
Average Spend per Customer (WoW) – Analyzing weekly spending habits across customers.
Growth Metrics – Tracking week-over-week growth to see changes in transaction volumes.
Customer Segmentation – Classifying customers into segments based on their weekly spending.
Real-Time Data Refresh: With this setup, once the data is refreshed in the database, users can easily refresh the dashboard to view the most current insights—no manual data upload needed.
💻 Technologies Used:

Power BI for building the dashboard and interactive visualizations.
SQL for managing and uploading transaction data into the database.
DAX for calculating key metrics and KPIs, including week-over-week comparisons and customer segmentation
This project demonstrates the power of automated reporting and how businesses can stay on top of their week-over-week trends with minimal effort. By leveraging Power BI, SQL, and DAX, I’ve built a seamless system where data updates flow directly into the dashboard with just a refresh.

I’d love to hear your thoughts or feedback on how this approach can be further enhanced!
